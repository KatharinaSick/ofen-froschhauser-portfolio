# Ofen Froschhauser

Simple portfolio website for my cousin. Available at [froschhauser.net](https://froschhauser.net).

Consists of two parts:

* ui: A React app that contains the portfolio website itself
* server: Backend app that's used to upload new pictures

> Disclaimer: The code in this repository could and definitely should be a lot cleaner. Still, I didn't have too much
> time to finish this website and therefore just focused on finishing it.
